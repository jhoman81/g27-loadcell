# g27-loadcell

A basic loadcell mod for the G27 pedals. A lot of code and ideas come from the following repos:

https://github.com/GeekyDeaks/g29-load-cell - 3d model for brake mod
https://github.com/Skidude88/Skidude88-G29-PS4-LoadCell-Arduino

As well as some code taken from elsewhere on the web to integrate the loadcell into a generic joystick using an Arduino Micro Pro. 

I would like to duplicate the functionality of https://github.com/n-e-y-s/G27_Pedals_and_Shifter/tree/n-e-y-s_devel with the work that SkiDude88 did with the Hx711 integration, but I still need to figure out exactly how that would work.
